3. My goal is to develop myself in programming because I really enjoy it. I spend almost all of my free time to get new knowledge and to practice in development. Programming gives me a lot of opportunities, for example I can create something in my home with my laptop, and somebody on the different side of the planet can use it without any problems. I've chosen frontend as a sphere because I can see result of my work with my eyes immediatly without any special tools for GUI. I study in Saint-Petersburg Mining University at the mineral processing faculty, but I realize, that I want to be a developer more than a mining engineer.
