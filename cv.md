3. My goal is to develop myself in programming because I really enjoy it. I spend almost all of my free time to get new knowledge and to practice in development. Programming gives me a lot of opportunities, for example I can create something in my home with my laptop, and somebody on the different side of the planet can use it without any problems. I've chosen frontend as a sphere because I can see result of my work with my eyes immediatly without any special tools for GUI.
4. HTML, CSS, JS, Git, Webpack, SASS
